StringPainter
===========

This is a simple line drawer application that converts the lines on canvas into an inner representation (size and origo). There are two kind of buffers 
that can be used: previous and next.

Usage
----------
- <B>[M]</B> toggle between the 2 input modes (previous and next)
- <B>[S]</B> save the actual buffers in a text file and the image
- <B>[B]</B> Delete the last added line in the actual mode

Compilation
---------------------
Change actual directory to build:
<pre># cd build</pre>

Create  the project files with cmake:
<pre># cmake ..</pre>
