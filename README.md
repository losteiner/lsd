Tiny psychedelic library for personal purpose.

This is a collection of code snipplets that makes my life a bit easier in order to have a common code base for daily problems.
The implementation is done in header files. There is no plan for complex class implementations so doesn't expect black magic or something.

Structure
=========
The implemented code is organized into directories and all of them contains a header with the same name as the folder. Including this will include all the components inside that folder.

- core: basic things like types, containers
- generic: data structures and algorithms
